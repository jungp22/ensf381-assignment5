Libraries used and how to install them (excluding those preinstalled from create-react-app):
"react-router-dom": "^6.22.3"
    - This was installed with "npm install react-router-dom"

Make sure Flask and Cors is also installed: 
- "pip install flask"
- "pip install -U flask-cors"

Start the app by navigating to the Backend directory and using command:
