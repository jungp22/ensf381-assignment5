From the assignment's main directory, run "npm install" to obtain node_modules folder,
may need to run "npm install react-router-dom --save" to obtain react-router-dom required to run
the app.

Libraries used and how to install them (excluding those preinstalled from create-react-app):
"react-router-dom": "^6.22.3"
    - This was installed with "npm install react-router-dom"

Make sure Flask and Cors are also installed: 
- "pip install flask"
- "pip install -U flask-cors"

Start the app by navigating to the Backend directory and using command:
- "python app.py"
then, from a second terminal, run: "npm start". 

close out of both front end and back end using Ctrl+C from both terminals.
